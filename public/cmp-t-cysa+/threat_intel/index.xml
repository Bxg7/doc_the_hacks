Requirements (Planning &amp;amp; Direction) Sets out the goals for the intelligence gathering effort (what do we wanna collec? what do we care about?)
Collection &amp;amp; Processing Implemented by software tools such as SIEMS to gather data which is then processed for later analysis.
The processing part is where we will convert all the data into a standard format.
Analysis Performed against the given use cases from the planning phase and may utilize automated analysis, AI, and machine learning.</description>
