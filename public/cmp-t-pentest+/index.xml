      <description>What is risk &amp;amp; where does risk exist?&#xA;Risk = the probability that a threat will be realized.&#xA;If you are a Cybersec analyst (blue teamer) you&amp;rsquo;re job is to minimize vulnerabilities.&#xA;If you are working as a pentester you&amp;rsquo;re job is to find and exploit vulnerabilities to proof that the network is truelly vulnerable to an outside attack.&#xA;Vulnerability = any weakness in the system design or implementation&#xA;Threat = anything that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to IT systems.</description>
