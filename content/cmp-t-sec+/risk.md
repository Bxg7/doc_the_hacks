What is risk & where does risk exist?   

Risk = the probability that a threat will be realized.  

If you are a Cybersec analyst (blue teamer) you're job is to minimize vulnerabilities.  
If you are working as a pentester you're job is to find and exploit vulnerabilities to proof that the network is truelly vulnerable to an outside attack.

Vulnerability = any weakness in the system design or implementation

Threat = anything that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to IT systems.
Risk exists within the intersection area between vulnerabilities and threats.

So if there is a vulnerability but no threat (or the other way around) there is no risk.    
Risk management finds ways to minimize the likelihood of a certain outcome from occuring and to achieve the desired outcomes.

Real world examples:    

Suppose you have a laptop with sensitive data on it but it has no internet connection then a remote exploitation will be hard.  

An armed bank robber is an example of a threat. A bank teller is an example of a valuable resource that may be vulnerable during a bank robbery. Bullet-proof glass between the robber and the teller denies the robber the opportunity to shoot the teller. The threat remains present, but one of its harmful effects (a gun shot) has been mitigated by a protection mechanism (the glass).

Inherent Risk = occurs when a risk has been identified but no mitigation factors are applied.

Residual Risk = occurs when we calculate the risk after applying mitigations and security controls. 
Example of residual risk = zero day vulnerability.

Risk exception = created risk due to an exemption being granted or failure or failure to comply with corporate policy.
