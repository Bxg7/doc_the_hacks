#### A SOC is a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets in an organization.
#### SOCs usually exist for larger corporations, goverment agencies and health care organisations (this is because its costly for smaller orgs who usually outsource it)
#### In order to be succesfull every SOC needs:

1) Have the authority to operate (supported by policies)
2) Have motivated and skilled staff (more important then you think)
3) Incorporate processes into a single operations center
4) equipped to perform incident response
5) able to protect itself and the organisation at large
6) Can seperate the signal from the noise
7) Collaborate with other SOCs for data sharing

#### The SOC should be the single point of contact for security, monitoring and incident respons
