We have to identify some factors to weigh the value of the intelligence that we are getting:

* Timeliness (ensures an intel source is up-to-date)
* Relevancy (ensures an intel source matches its intended use case)
* Accuracy (ensures an intel source produces effective results. IE: the information needs to be valid & true. Eliminating false positives is important.)
* Confidence level (ensures an intel source produces qualified statements about reliability. "Putting a grade on how good this information is")

The three place where you can get information from is:

* Proprietary (threat intel widely provides as a commercial service offering, where access to updates and research is subject to a subscription fee)
* Closed-Source (data derived from the providers own research and analysis efforts, such as data from honeynets that they operate, plus info minded from its customers systems, suitably anonymized)
* Open-Source (available without subscription, which include threat feeds, reputation lists and malware signature databases)

Some Open-Source sources:

Threat feeds are a form of explicit knowledge, but implicit knowledge from experienced practitioners is also useful
