Security Intelligence is the process where data is generated and is then collected, processed, analyzed, and disseminated to provide <u> insights into the security status of information systems </u>

Cyber Threat Intelligence is the investigation, collection, analysis and dissemination of information about emerging threats and threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape

#### So the difference between these two is: Security Intelligence is looking INWARD (how are our systems looking), while Cyber Threat Intelligence is looking OUTWARD (what are the attacker groups up to, what are the malware outbreaks or zero-day exploits.)

Cyber Security Intelligence can come to us in two forms:

* Narrative report (ie the analysis of a certain adversary group or a certain type of malware) -> mainly created by Threat Analysts
* Data feeds (can for example be a list of known bad indicators, like indicators of compromise (ioc's), domain names, ip addresses, hashes of malware code)

We use both the get the best security posture for our organisation.

Some examples of companies that produce these types of intelligence reports are:

* Mcafee
* FireEye
* Red Canary
