Intelligence is a process

![cycle](cycle.png)

#### Requirements (Planning & Direction)

Sets out the goals for the intelligence gathering effort (what do we wanna collec? what do we care about?)

#### Collection & Processing

Implemented by software tools such as SIEMS to gather data which is then processed for later analysis.

<u>The processing part is where we will convert all the data into a standard format.</u>

#### Analysis

Performed against the given use cases from the planning phase and may utilize automated analysis, AI, and machine learning.

Seperating data into buckets: 

![bucket](bucket.png)

Known good = allow
Known bad = block
Not sure = needs further analysis

#### Dissemination

Publishes information produced by analysts to consumers who need to act on the insights developed

3 common ways that we like to break up this dissemination is:

* Strategic intelligence (projects and business priorities over weeks or months. For example certain best practices. For example presented to management as a powerpoint)
* Operational intelligence (addressing the day to day priorities of managers and specialists, often put out as a checklist that we should be worried / focussed on today)
* Tactical intelligence (informs real-time decisions made by staff as they encounter different alerts and system indications. Like on the SIEM watch floor.)

<u> Dissemination involves sharing the intelligence findings with relevant stakeholders. This can include security teams, incident responders, executives, and even external partners or information-sharing communities. </u>

#### Feedback

Aims to clarify requirements and improve the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information by reviewing current inputs and outputs. Basically: how can we do things better?
(lessons learned, measurable success, evolving threat issues)
