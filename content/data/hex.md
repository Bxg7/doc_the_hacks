Hexadecimal is a base 16 system used to simplify how binary is represented.  
A hex digit can be any of the following 16 digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F.  

Every HEX digit is represented by a sequence of 4 bits (also sometimes called a "nibble").  
4 bits is exactly half of a byte, which is 8 bits.  

A value in HEX is often represented by prepending the prefix 0x to the value.  
0x1F is pronounced as: "hex-one-f"  

An 8-bit binary number can be written using only two different hex digits - one hex digit for each nibble (or group of 4-bits).  
It is much easier to write numbers as hex than to write them as binary numbers.  

Hex codes are used in many areas of computing to simplify binary codes. It is important to note that computers do not use hexadecimal - it is used by humans to shorten binary to a more easily understandable form. Hexadecimal is translated into binary for computer use. Some examples of where hex is used include:

* colour references
* assembly language programs
* error messages
