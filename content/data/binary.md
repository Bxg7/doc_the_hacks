Binary is Base 2, unlike our Decimal counting system which is Base 10. In other words, Binary has only 2 different numerals (0 and 1) to denote a value, unlike Decimal which has 10 numerals (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9). A value in binary is sometimes represented by prepending the prefix 0b to the value.  

Example: 0b01011101
